## Bio

I am a Data Scientist at Netflix. I received my 
PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan in 2021. 

I write about statistical ideas [here](blog.html), and ideas related to the 
built environment at my blog [xstreetvalidated](https://xstreetvalidated.com).

You can get updated when I write anywhere via my 
[substack](https://articulatednote.substack.com/?r=6395r&utm_campaign=pub-share-checklist).
