    "section": "(1) Personal Attitude",
    "text": "(1) Personal Attitude\nOne’s personal attitude towards the PhD will define everything else learned from it. One key lesson worth learning early on is to let go of your ego. This is easier said than done, as everyone in academia care’s a lot about their intelligence – obviously. That’s how we got to be in graduate school after all – so learning to accept that you’re not that smart and that there’s still a lot one has to learn before becoming a peer of the academy can take some getting used to. Further, it helps to be acclimated to the lifestyle. You need to be very self-driven to get a PhD, as there is much less structure as compared to a M.S. program and one’s experience is largely determined by what the student makes of it. This means that while, yes you can get up any time you want in the day, it helps if you’re self-disciplined enough to get up at such a time that you still get the things done that you need to in order to make progress in your research."

    "text": "(2) Approach to the Problem; Research Philosophy\nThere’s two things to think about under this heading: (i) The Science (referring to a specific branch of science) and (ii) the Statistics\n\nThis is where a statistician would typically collaborate with “subject-matter experts”. That is, other scientists who are more familiar with the conceptual models, standards in the field and so on that define the current state of knowledge and research within the domain of study. Questions in this domain may follow fairly easily from the questions that are most often posed in the literature, or they may be more subtly hidden.\nConcerns research that extends old or develops new statistical ideas for the purposes of providing statisticians or other scientists with more tools to model natural phenomenon. For example creating a new distribution on the space of some species of graphs I’d consider to be something like “Pure” Statistics research. It may be the case (for the better) that this is developed with an application in mind and so the statistical idea may be merely an adaptation or tweaking of previously established methods to a new kind of data structure or problem. Both would fall under the heading of what’s called “Methods Research”."

    "section": "(3) Statistical Philosophy",
    "text": "(3) Statistical Philosophy\nMy foundational training was in what is commonly referred to as “classical” or Frequentist statistics. There’s good reason for this as this approach laid the groundwork for much of the applied statistical work that is done today. From the get-go though, I was interested in and hearing about the “new kid on the block”: Bayesian statistics. Of course, this philosophy isn’t all that new, with the first documented work describing Bayesian statistics, going way back to the 1700s, with a work authored by Laplace. I found there to be a number of reasons Bayesian statistics is worth learning in the modern era, principal among them the phenomenon of “concentration of measure”, which provides evidence that the posterior mode (the frequentist’s standard maximum likelihood estimator) is not an “appropriate” description of the posterior distribution in high dimensional spaces. As high dimensional spaces characterize a lot of the work in advanced statistics, this is of increasing importance. There is a nice case study by Bob Carpenter, that tries to provide intuition for these ideas via simulation, as well as a more technical discussion of these ideas here in the stan forums."
