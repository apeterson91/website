I recently gave a talk at the Ann Arbor R User's Group about [STAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10208) models and the [rstap](https://biostatistics4socialimpact.github.io/rstap/) package.
The slides for the talk are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13ZOZ9Y9hbSyxFMb2zEesTAsJ46yvGCxP/view?usp=sharing) and the video can be seen [here](https://www.periscope.tv/w/1ypKdvRdkDvJW).
