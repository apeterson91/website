abstract: The presence of specific built environment resources such as food vendors or recreation centers may impact diet and physical activity, thereby affecting the subsequent risk of important health conditions like cardiovascular disease. Of particular interest to investigators are types of spatial patterns that describe the availability of a particular resource near a location where subjects frequently spend their time, residential neighborhoods or schools, for example. To describe these types of spatial patterns, we model the spatial distribution of fast food restaurants around each school as a one-dimensional Inhomogeneous Poisson Process (IPP). We cluster the spatially varying intensities of the IPPs using the Nested Dirichlet Process which allows us to group schools into environment types. Our modeling approach is non-parametric in that the number of clusters is not chosen a priori: more clusters can be added in accordance with the best marginal density fit and the shape of the intensity function across distance from the school is data-driven.
