I recently gave a guest lecture to the Biostatistics PhD students at [Drexel](https://drexel.edu/dornsife/) on [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/).
For whoever may also find themselves in need of an introduction, the slides are available {{% staticref "files/RcppIntro_handout.pdf" %}}here {{% /staticref %}}.
