 I'm giving a talk this upcoming Wednesday at the DataPhilly [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/).
 I'll be discussing some work adapting Nested Dirichlet Processes for built environment data. The slides are linked {{% staticref "files/DataPhilly.pdf" %}}here {{% /staticref %}} and I'll post the video when it is available.
