While I'm  no longer able to participate in the [Statistical Learning](https://zhenkewu.com/teaching/statistical_learning_reading_group) Reading Group at Michigan,
I was a huge fan of reading the articles each week  and thought I would post the slides of the articles I presented here in case anyone happens to find themselves interested.    
While I don't mention it in these slides specifically, I remember there being a widespread concern about the likely non-identifiability of the recovered parameters 
in this model, a common issue in machine learning methods. While this wouldn't be as big of a concern if the aim were prediction, the authors did have the inference of the latent gaussian process as 
one of their inferential goals. Still, a very stimulating paper overall. 
It was originally presented at NIPS in 2018. The slides are linked {{% staticref "files/LGP_paper.pdf" %}}here {{% /staticref %}}. and the pdf can be found [here](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6941-gaussian-process-based-nonlinear-latent-structure-discovery-in-multivariate-spike-train-data.pdf).
