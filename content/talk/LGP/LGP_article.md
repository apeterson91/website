While I'm  no longer able to participate in the Bayesian - Machine Learning Reading group at Michigan,
I was a huge fan of the group and thought I would post the slides of the articles I presented here in case
anyone happens to find themselves interested. While I don't mention it in these slides specifically,
I remember there being a widespread concern about the likely non-identifiability of the recovered parameters 
in this model, a common issue in machine learning models. While this wouldn't be as big of a concern 
if the aim were prediction, the authors did have the inference of the latent gaussian process as 
one of their inferential goals. Still, a very stimulating paper overall. 
It was originally presented at NIPS in 2018. The slides are linked [here](static/files/LGP_paper.pdf) and the pdf can be found [here](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6941-gaussian-process-based-nonlinear-latent-structure-discovery-in-multivariate-spike-train-data.pdf).
