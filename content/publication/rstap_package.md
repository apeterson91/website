title = rstap: An R Package for Spatial Temporal Aggregated Predictor Models
---

The **rstap package** implements Bayesian spatial temporal aggregated predictor models in R using
the probabilistic programming language Stan. A variety of distributions and link functions are
supported, allowing users to fit this extension to the generalized linear model with both independent
and correlated outcomes.
